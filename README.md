# ChartJsMigration

see https://jvanek.fedorapeople.org/charts/

this is keeping track of changes of migrating set of charts from chartjs1 to chartjs4. Original idea was to go version by version, but that proved to be nonsense, so the direct jump 1 to 4 was done, and only 4 is adapted.

First commit, adapting dataset to be accepted by chartjs 2 and up, is missing. But you can still get it by diffing chartjs1 against2 or other.. eg:



chart4.js is not working, idk why. Use chart4-umd.js instead
